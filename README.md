A Command-Line Interface Chat Application made using Python3 and Sockets Module

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/MysteryCoder456/PythonChatCLI)](https://repl.it/github/MysteryCoder456/PythonChatCLI)

## Running this App
**Running on Local Networks:** First, run the `server.py` script on any computer on your Locla Network. Then, on either the same computer on a different computer (on the same network), run the `client.py` script and enter the IP address and Port on which the `server.py` script is running. The IP and Port are both display when you run the `server.py` script.

**Running on the Internet**: Before you continue, keep in mind that leaking your Public IP address can be very dangerous. It is recommended that you use a Dynamic IP Address to hide your real Public IP address. You also need to use Port Forwarding to forward any traffic at a particular port to the computer running the server script. After that the steps are the same as running on a Local Network except you enter the server's Public IP address and use the Port that you Forwarded in you router settings.
